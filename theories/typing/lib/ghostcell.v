(* This library should be valid under weak memory, but the current
   model of Lambdarust-weak makes this challenging to prove. The
   reasons are:

     - The SC model in this file relies crucially on using the atomic accessors
       of borrows, which are much weaker (when they exist) in weakmem. The
       reason of this weakness is that, when we are not in SC, we cannot tel
       that a lifetime is "either alive or dead", since it can be "dead", but
       in a way which is not yet synchronized with the current thread.

   So let's search for another model:
     - We have to prove that successive mutable accesses to the ghost cell are
       synchronized (i.e., they are in happens-before relationship).
     - The only reason these accesses are indeed synchronized is that the *ghost
       token* is transmitted via mechanisms guaranteeing happens-before
       relationship (like every resource transfer in Rust).
     - In particular, when the borrow of a ghost token ends, the ghost token
       needs to change its internal state to remember the view of the death of
       its lifetime. Indeed, the death of the corresponding lifetime is an
       essential link in the synchronization chain between two successive
       accesses to the ghost cell.
     - In the lifetime logic, the only way to allow updates at the death of a
       lifetime is through the "consequence view-shift" of [bor_acc_strong]:
          ▷ Q -∗ [†κ'] ={userE}=∗ ▷ P
     - However, unfortunately, this "consequence view-shift" take a subjective
       version of the death token in weak_mem:
          ▷ Q -∗ subj [†κ'] ={userE}=∗ ▷ P
       As a result, the view at which this view shift is used is independent
       from the actual "view of the death of the lifetime", so we have no
       information about it.
     - The reason why this is a subjective token in weak-mem is because of what
       happens when a non-atomic lifetime dies (a non-atomic lifetime is the
       intersection of other lifetimes). Indeed, a non-atomic lifetime can die
       "several times", once for each component, and each of these death can
       occur at non-comparable views. The only relevant view that we would pass
       to the consequence view-shift is the view used for the inheritance of
       the borrow, but that view is not necessarily well-defined since the
       borrow can be the result of a merging of other borrows.
    Hence, it sounds like that the main blocking point is the merging rule of
    the lifetime logic, which we use very rarely in the model (only for
    merging actual borrows in [tctx_merge_uniq_prod2]). So it might be mossible
    to remove the merging rule from the lifetime logic to get rid of the
    subjective modality in the consequence view-shift and finally get a model
    for GhostCell under weak memory...

  (* Idea:
     Ghostcell is basically a refcell/rwlock.  Main difference being that current r/w state is
     not directly tied to any physical state (for ty_shr); in other words, you can't really do
     anything with just a ghostcell.  The ghosttoken is responsible for tracking the r/w state of any
     ghostcells that are currently open.  A share of a ghosttoken always tracks the exact fraction
     that it is sharing.  It may not actually be necessary for the ghosttoken to track these things
     explicitly, since a read borrow is the same as a regular borrow.

     Key point: you don't really need to prove you can go from a borrow back to the original
     resource under normal circumstances.  For atomic borrows you just need to show that the
     thing inside the atomic borrow holds initially (which can just be the original borrow you
     got plus some ownership of ghost state, if you want).  To *update* an atomic borrow, you
     just have to show you can go back to the original resource *or* the token is dead.
     To update an original borrow (and not change the mask) you need to show that the token is
     alive initially, and that the resource to which you want to update it can move back to P
     with the empty mask and no access to the token you povided.  bor_acc_atomic and friends do
     other stuff.

    (when the lifetime is dead it can
     be removed from the track set).
